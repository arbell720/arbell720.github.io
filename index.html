<h1>Project to lower alcohol consumption at two high schools</h1>

<p>The goal of this exercise is to use a series of visualizations to find if data collected from two Italian high schools could lead to any strategies to lower alcohol consumption by students.</p>

<p>Data was collected from about 400 students and includes data that might affect the level of alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>Much of hte data is stored as numerical values such as 1 to 5.  In such cases, 5 would represent a high value with 1 representing a low value. For instance, 
for "going out with friends" a 5 would represent a high amount of time spent out with friends while 1 would represent a lower amount</p>

<p>Data is from Kaggle and is located at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption</p>

<h2>Looking at correlation between various factors and weekday alcohol consumption by rank</h2>

<p>In this visualization, various factors can be selected and the possible effect they have on weekday alcohol consumptions can be seen. There are two selections. 
The first selection controls the factor on the y axis and contols the location of the points. The second selection controls the color of the points. 
Using both selectors allows the user to see the possible effect of two different factors on weekday alcohol consumption.  
The x axis represents all the students ranked by weekday alcohol consumption. Those consuming more alcohol have a higher rank and are on the right side of the graph.</p>

<h2>Looking at correlation between various factors and weekend alcohol consumption by rank</h2>

<p>In this visualization, various factors can be selected and the possible effect they have on weekend alcohol consumptions can be seen.  There are two selections.  
The first selection controls the factor on the y axis and contols the location of the points.  The second selection controls the color of the points.  
Using both selectors allows the user to see the possible effect of two different factors on weekend alcohol consumption.  
The x axis represents all the students ranked by weekday alcohol consumption.  Those consuming more alcohol have a higher rank and are on the right side of the graph.</p>

<h2>Looking at correlation between various factors and weekday alcohol consumption by value</h2>

<p>In this visualization, various factors can be selected and the possible effect they have on weekday alcohol consumptions can be seen. 
There is one selector where one factor can be selected and the possible effect of that factor on weekday alcohol consumption can be seen. 
This chart differs from the one above related to ranking students by weekday alcohol consumption as students are no longer ranked. 
In this case, the circles are larger at points where more students are represented. 
For instance if 200 of 400 students fall into a particular point that circle would be very large.</p>
